  <h2>Home Exchange: Beautiful Swiss Village (Unterägeri)</h2>
  <p>We are an international family of four (2 adults, 2 kids – a 16-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy) looking to exchange our home in Switzerland for 1-3 weeks from mid-July to mid-August 2024. We’re interested in a home exchange with families in the <strong>San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley</strong>, or <strong>Los Angeles</strong> (preferably Marina del Rey or other neighborhoods) and possibly <strong>San Diego</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Our Home & Location</h2>
  <p>We live in a spacious, ground-floor apartment in the picturesque Swiss village of <strong>Unterägeri</strong>, located in the canton of <strong>Zug</strong>. The apartment has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a large open-plan kitchen, living, and dining area. We also have a private garden with a nearby playground in a lovely, peaceful area.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A beautiful lake, 14 km all around, perfect for walks and water activities.</li>
    <li>Forests, mountains, and scenic bike & hike trails right at your doorstep.</li>
    <li>10 minutes' drive to Zug, 45 minutes to Zurich, and 45 minutes to Luzern.</li>
    <li>An ideal base for exploring central Switzerland or simply relaxing in a peaceful, nature-filled environment.</li>
  </ul>
